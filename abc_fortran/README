Notice for this part!!!
1. To calculate the force in neb, have to use n_pes=100!
2. To build up the connnection matrix, use fine structure n_min<n_pes! (in the file 'fine_min.dat')

Output of this part:
1. conMatrix.dat for the connection relation and coordinates
2. barMatrix.dat for the barrier relation and energetics
